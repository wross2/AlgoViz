# About

This is a personal project built to visualize some popular computer science algorithms. The site is completely static and is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and should be live [here](https://algov1z.netlify.app).


# Function

In it's current iteration, the site supports two popular sorting algorithms: [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort). The site also features a slider for the user to dynamically control the number of values to be sorted (10 minimum, 50 maximum.)

# Weaknesses

The site is currently not optimized for a mobile experience. In other words, it does not look quite as intended when on smaller screens because I have not added the necessary responsiveness to the site. So, please view on a larger screen for a better experience.
